# Task-1-Iris-Flower-Classification



## Internship Details

* **Company:** The Black Pearls
* **Internship Period:** June 15, 2024 - July 15, 2024 

## Introduction

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into their respective species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica) based on their petal and sepal measurements. This project reinforces essential classification, feature engineering, and model evaluation skills applicable to various business challenges. 

## Dataset and Features

* **Data Source:** The project utilizes the classic Iris dataset, a widely used benchmark in machine learning. 
    * The dataset was loaded from a CSV file located at '/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/Iris.csv'. 
* **Features:**
    * **Sepal Length (cm):** Length of the flower's sepal.
    * **Sepal Width (cm):** Width of the flower's sepal.
    * **Petal Length (cm):**  Length of the flower's petal.
    * **Petal Width (cm):**  Width of the flower's petal.
* **Data Preprocessing:**
    * **Label Encoding:** The 'Species' column, which contains categorical values (setosa, versicolor, virginica), was encoded into numerical labels using `LabelEncoder` for model compatibility.
    * **Standardization:** The features were standardized using `StandardScaler` to have zero mean and unit variance, improving model performance, which is crucial in many business-oriented machine learning tasks.

## Methodology

* **Approach:** This project employs supervised learning for classification. 
* **Algorithms:** The primary algorithm used is K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
* **Model Selection:** A grid search (`GridSearchCV`) with 5-fold cross-validation was performed to find the optimal number of neighbors (`n_neighbors`) for the KNN model.  Grid search is a valuable technique for optimizing model parameters in various data science applications. The best-performing model was selected based on accuracy.

## Results and Evaluation

* **Key Findings:** The KNN model achieved high accuracy in classifying iris species.
* **Performance Metrics:**
    * **Accuracy:** 1.00 
    * **Confusion Matrix:**
    ```
     [[10  0  0]
      [ 0  9  0]
      [  0  0 11]] 
    ```
* **Visualizations:** Visualizations generated by this project, including a confusion matrix heatmap, decision boundary visualization, and pair plot, can be found in the `/visualizations` folder. 

## Conclusion

* **Summary:** This project successfully demonstrated the application of the KNN algorithm for accurate iris flower classification. Feature scaling and hyperparameter tuning using grid search contributed to the model's performance.
* **Future Work:**
    * Experiment with additional classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees) to potentially improve performance further.
    * Explore different feature engineering techniques to potentially create more informative features.
    * Apply the model to a real-world dataset with similar characteristics to assess its generalizability. 

## Technical Information

* **Installation:**
    * Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
    * Install the required libraries: `pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn`
* **How to Run:**
    1. Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `iris_classification.py`).
    2. Replace  `'/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/Iris.csv'`  with the actual path to your Iris dataset file.
    3. Run the script:  `python iris_classification.py`
